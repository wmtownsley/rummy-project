# Rummy Rules — Rummy2go

## Overview

Two players take turns drawing and discarding cards, trying to form **melds** (groups of matching cards). The round ends when one player **goes out** by playing all their cards. Cards in melds score positive points; cards left in hand score negative.

## The Deck

- Standard 52-card deck (no jokers)
- Aces are low or high, (Q-K-A-2-3 is valid

## Card Point Values

| Card                  | Value     |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Ace                   | 15 points |
| 2–9                   | 5 points  |
| 10, Jack, Queen, King | 10 points |

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck
2. Deal **7 cards** to each player
3. Place the remaining deck face down (the **draw pile**)
4. Turn the top card face up next to it (the **discard pile**)
5. Non-dealer goes first

## On Your Turn

1. **Draw cards** — either:
   - Draw one top card of the draw pile (face down, unknown), OR
   - Draw one top card of the discard pile (face up, known)
   - Draw more than one cards from the discard pile, as a group between the top card and another card deeper in the pile (including the entire pile). The "deepest" card MUST be played (either as part of a meld or lay off on existing meld) on that turn. 

2. **Optionally lay down melds** (see below)

3. **Optionally lay off cards** on existing melds (yours or opponent's)

4. **Discard one card** face up onto the discard pile — this ends your turn

You must always draw at the start and discard at the end. You cannot discard the same card you just picked up from the discard pile.

## Melds

There are two types:

- **Set (group):** 3 or 4 cards of the **same rank** (e.g., 7♠ 7♥ 7♦)
- **Run (sequence):** 3 or more cards of the **same suit in order** (e.g., 4♥ 5♥ 6♥)

## Laying Off

On your turn, you may add cards from your hand to **any meld on the table** (yours or your opponent's). For example:
- Add a 4th card to a set of three
- Extend a run (e.g., add 7♥ to a run of 4♥ 5♥ 6♥)

## Going Out

A player **goes out** when they have no cards left in their hand. Discarding is optional only when going out. This ends the round. 

## Scoring

When a player goes out:
- **Cards in melds:** score their point value as **positive** points for the player who laid them
- **Cards left in hand:** score their point value as **negative** points

## Winning

Players play multiple rounds. Keep a tally of all games, + or - scores for each player, running total, and delta.
